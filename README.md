# Nearest-Neighbor-Clustering-Using-Distributed-System
Distributed computing is the future for industrial implementation of complex ML algorithms where we are dealing with terabytes of data on daily basis.
To make any algorithm scalable a knowledge of how to implement it in a distributed system is required. Hence, an implementation of KNN and Bisecting K-Means are developed to serve as example on how to develop algorithms for Spark and Hadoop based distributed system.
* KNN: A KNN based algorithm is developed in Spark (knnSpark.py) and Hadoop (knn.java)
* Clustering: Bisecting KMeans algorithm is developed in Spark (bisectingspark.py) and Hadoop (bkm.java)
